<prayers><prayer title="Medium Obligatory Prayer" citation="" author="Bahá’u’lláh" category="Obligatory" wordCount="498">&lt;p class="commentcaps">To be recited daily, in the morning, at noon, and in the evening.&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="comment">Whoso wisheth to pray, let him wash his hands, and while he washeth, let him say:&lt;p>

&lt;p class="opening">&lt;span class="versal">S&lt;/span>trengthen my hand, O my God, that it may take hold of Thy Book with such steadfastness that the hosts of the world shall have no power over it.  Guard it, then, from meddling with whatsoever doth not belong unto it.  Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">And while washing his face, let him say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>I have turned my face unto Thee, O my Lord! Illumine it with the light of Thy countenance.  Protect it, then, from turning to anyone but Thee.&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Then let him stand up, and facing the Qiblih (Point of Adoration, i.e., Bahjí, ‘Akká), let him say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him.  His are the kingdoms of Revelation and of creation.  He, in truth, hath manifested Him Who is the Dayspring of Revelation, Who conversed on Sinai, through Whom the Supreme Horizon hath been made to shine, and the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing hath spoken, and through Whom the call hath been proclaimed unto all who are in heaven and on earth: “Lo, the All-Possessing is come.  Earth and heaven, glory and dominion are God's, the Lord of all men, and the Possesser of the Throne on high and of earth below!”&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Let him, then, bend down, with hands resting on the knees, and say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>Exalted art Thou above my praise and the praise of anyone beside me, above my description and the description of all who are in heaven and all who are on earth!&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Then, standing with open hands, palms upward toward the face, let him say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>Disappoint not, O my God, him that hath, with beseeching fingers, clung to the hem of Thy mercy and Thy grace, O Thou Who of those who show mercy art the Most Merciful!&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Let him, then, be seated and say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>I bear witness to Thy unity and Thy oneness, and that Thou art God, and that there is none other God beside Thee.  Thou hast, verily, revealed Thy Cause, fulfilled Thy Covenant, and opened wide the door of Thy grace to all that dwell in heaven and on earth.  Blessing and peace, salutation and glory, rest upon Thy loved ones, whom the changes and chances of the world have not deterred from turning unto Thee, and who have given their all, in the hope of obtaining that which is with Thee.  Thou art, in truth, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">(If anyone choose to recite instead of the long verse these words: “God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting,” it would be sufficient.  And likewise, it would suffice were he, while seated, to choose to recite these words: “I bear witness to Thy unity and Thy oneness, and that Thou art God, and that there is none other God beside Thee.”)&lt;p>

&lt;p class="opening">&lt;span class="versal">I&lt;/span> bear witness, O my God, that Thou hast created me to know Thee and to worship Thee.  I testify, at this moment, to my powerlessness and to Thy might, to my poverty and to Thy wealth.&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Whoso wisheth to recite this prayer, let him stand up and turn unto God and, as he standeth in his place, let him gaze to the right and to the left, as if awaiting the mercy of his Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Then let him say:&lt;p>

&lt;p class="opening">&lt;span class="versal">O&lt;/span> Thou Who art the Lord of all names and the Maker of the heavens!  I beseech Thee by them Who are the Day-Springs of Thine invisible Essence, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, to make of my prayer a fire that will burn away the veils which have shut me out from Thy beauty, and a light that will lead me unto the ocean of Thy Presence.&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Let him then raise his hands in supplication toward God—blessed and exalted be he—and say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>O Thou the Desire of the world and the Beloved of the nations!  Thou seest me turning toward Thee, and rid of all attachment to any one save Thee, and clinging to Thy cord, through whose movement the whole creation hath been stirred up.  I am Thy servant, O my Lord, and the son of Thy servant.  Behold me standing ready to do Thy will and Thy desire, and wishing naught else except Thy good pleasure.  I implore Thee by the Ocean of Thy mercy and the Daystar of Thy grace to do with Thy servant as Thou willest and pleasest.  By Thy might which is far above all mention and praise!  Whatsoever is revealed by Thee is the desire of my heart and the beloved of my soul.  O God, my God!  Look not upon my hopes and my doings, nay rather look upon Thy will that hath encompassed the heavens and the earth.  By Thy Most Great Name, O Thou Lord of all nations!  I have desired only what Thou didst desire, and love only what Thou dost love.&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Let him then kneel, and bowing his forehead to the ground, let him say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>Exalted art Thou above the description of any one save Thyself, and the comprehension of aught else except Thee.&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Let him then stand and say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>Make my prayer, O my Lord, a fountain of living waters whereby I may live as long as Thy sovereignty endureth, and may make mention of Thee in every world of Thy worlds.&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Let him again raise his hands in supplication, and say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>O Thou in separation from Whom hearts and souls have melted, and by the fire of Whose love the whole world hath been set aflame!  I implore Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the whole creation, not to withhold from me that which is with Thee, O Thou Who rulest over all men!  Thou seest, O my Lord, this stranger hastening to his most exalted home beneath the canopy of Thy majesty and within the precincts of Thy mercy; and this transgressor seeking the ocean of Thy forgiveness; and this lowly one the court of Thy glory; and this poor creature the orient of Thy wealth.  Thine is the authority to command whatsoever Thou willest.  I bear witness that Thou art to be praised in Thy doings, and to be obeyed in Thy behests, and to remain unconstrained in Thy bidding.&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Let him then raise his hands, and repeat three times the Greatest Name (“Alláh-u-Abhá”).  Let him then bend down with hands resting on the knees before God—blessed and exalted be He—and say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>Thou seest, O my God, how my spirit hath been stirred up within my limbs and members, in its longing to worship Thee, and in its yearning to remember Thee and extol Thee; how it testifieth to that whereunto the tongue of Thy Commandment hath testified in the kingdom of Thine utterance and the heaven of Thy knowledge.  I love in this state, O my Lord, to beg of Thee all that is with Thee, that I may demonstrate my poverty, and magnify Thy bounty and Thy riches, and may declare my powerlessness, and manifest Thy power and Thy might.&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Let him then stand and raise his hands twice in supplication, and say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.  There is no God but Thee, the Ordainer, both in the beginning and in the end.  O God, my God!  Thy forgiveness hath emboldened me, and Thy mercy hath strengthened me and Thy call hath awakened me, and Thy grace hath raised me up and led me unto Thee.  Who, otherwise, am I that I should dare to stand at the gate of the city of Thy nearness, or set my face toward the lights that are shining from the heaven of Thy will?  Thou seest, O my Lord, this wretched creature knocking at the door of Thy grace, and this evanescent soul seeking the river of everlasting life from the hands of Thy bounty.  Thine is the command at all times, O Thou Who art the Lord of all names; and mine is resignation and willing submission to Thy will, O Creator of the heavens! &lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Let him then raise his hands thrice, and say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>Greater is God than every great one!&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Let him then kneel, and bowing his forehead to the ground, say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>Too high art Thou for the praise of those who are nigh unto Thee to ascend unto the heaven of Thy nearness, or for the birds of the hearts of them who are devoted to Thee to attain to the door of Thy gate.  I testify that Thou hast been sanctified above all attributes and holy above all names.  No God is there but Thee, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious.&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Let him then seat himself and say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>I testify unto that whereunto have testified all created things, and the Concourse on high, and the inmates of the all-highest Paradise, and beyond them the Tongue of Grandeur itself from the all-glorious Horizon, that Thou art God, that there is no God but Thee, and that He Who hath been manifested is the Hidden Mystery, the Treasured Symbol, through Whom the letters B and E (Be) have been joined and knit together.  I testify that it is He Whose name hath been set down by the Pen of the Most High, and Who hath been mentioned in the Books of God, the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below.&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Let him then stand erect and say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>O Lord of all being and Possessor of all things visible and invisible!  Thou dost perceive my tears and the sighs I utter, and hearest my groaning, and my wailing, and the lamentation of my heart.  By Thy might!  My trespasses have kept me back from drawing nigh unto Thee; and my sins have held me far from the court of Thy holiness.  Thy love, O my Lord, hath enriched me, and separation from Thee hath destroyed me, and remoteness from Thee hath consumed me.  I entreat Thee by Thy footsteps in this wilderness, and by the words “Here am I. Here am I” which Thy chosen Ones have uttered in this immensity, and by the breaths of Thy Revelation, and the gentle winds of the Dawn of thy Manifestation, to ordain that I may gaze on Thy beauty and observe whatsoever is in Thy Book.&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Let him then repeat the Greatest Name thrice, and bend down with hands resting on the knees, and say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>Praise be to Thee, O my God, that Thou hast aided me to remember Thee and to praise Thee, and hast made known unto me Him Who is the Dayspring of Thy signs, and hast caused me to bow down before Thy Lordship, and humble myself before Thy Godhead, and to acknowledge that which hath been uttered by the Tongue of Thy grandeur.&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Let him then rise and say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>O God, my God!  My back is bowed by the burden of my sins, and my heedlessness hath destroyed me.  Whenever I ponder my evil doings and Thy benevolence, my heart melteth within me, and my blood boileth in my veins.  By Thy Beauty, O Thou the Desire of the world!  I blush to lift up my face to Thee, and my longing hands are ashamed to stretch forth toward the heaven of Thy bounty.  Thou seest, O my God, how my tears prevent me from remembering Thee and from extolling Thy virtues, O Thou the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below!  I implore Thee by the signs of Thy Kingdom and the mysteries of Thy Dominion to do with Thy loved ones as becometh Thy bounty, O Lord of all being, and is worthy of Thy grace, O King of the seen and the unseen! &lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Let him then repeat the Greatest Name thrice, and kneel with his forehead to the ground, and say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>Praise be unto Thee, O our God, that Thou has sent down unto us that which draweth us nigh unto Thee, and supplieth us with every good thing sent down by Thee in thy Books and thy Scriptures.  Protect us, we beseech Thee, O my Lord, from the hosts of idle fancies and vain imaginations.  Thou, in truth, art the Mighty, the All-Knowing.&lt;p>

&lt;p class="comment">Let him then raise his head, and seat himself, and say:&lt;p>

&lt;p>I testify, O my God, to that whereunto Thy chosen Ones have testified, and acknowledge that which the inmates of the all-highest Paradise and those who have circled round Thy mighty Throne have acknowledged.  The kingdoms of earth and heaven are Thine, O Lord of the worlds!&lt;p>

</prayer><prayer title="O Thou Whose face is the object..." citation="" author="Bahá’u’lláh" category="Aid and Assistance" wordCount="110">&lt;p class="opening">&lt;span class="versal">O&lt;/span> Thou Whose face is the object of my adoration, Whose beauty is my sanctuary, Whose habitation is my goal, Whose praise is my hope, Whose providence is my companion, Whose love is the cause of my being, Whose mention is my solace, Whose nearness is my desire, Whose presence is my dearest wish and highest aspiration, I entreat Thee not to withhold from me the things Thou didst ordain for the chosen ones among Thy servants.  Supply me, then, with the good of this world and of the next.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thou, truly, art the King of all men.  There is no God but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.&lt;/p></prayer><prayer title="My God, my Adored One, my King..." citation="" author="Bahá’u’lláh" category="Aid and Assistance" wordCount="156">&lt;p class="opening">&lt;span class="versal">M&lt;/span>y God, my Adored One, my King, my Desire!  What tongue can voice my thanks to Thee?  I was heedless, Thou didst awaken me.  I had turned back from Thee, Thou didst graciously aid me to turn towards Thee.  I was as one dead, Thou didst quicken me with the water of life.  I was withered, Thou didst revive me with the heavenly stream of Thine utterance which hath flowed forth from the Pen of the All-Merciful.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>O Divine Providence!  All existence is begotten by Thy bounty; deprive it not of the waters of Thy generosity, neither do Thou withhold it from the ocean of Thy mercy.  I beseech Thee to aid and assist me at all times and under all conditions, and seek from the heaven of Thy grace Thine ancient favor.  Thou art, in truth, the Lord of bounty, and the Sovereign of the kingdom of eternity.&lt;/p></prayer><prayer title="Lauded be Thy Name, O Lord our God!" citation="" author="The Báb" category="Aid and Assistance" wordCount="295">&lt;p class="opening">&lt;span class="versal">L&lt;/span>auded be Thy Name, O Lord our God!  Thou art in truth the Knower of things unseen.  Ordain for us such good as Thine all-embracing knowledge can measure.  Thou art the sovereign Lord, the Almighty, the Best-Beloved.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>All praise be unto Thee, O Lord!  We shall seek Thy grace on the appointed Day and shall put our whole reliance in Thee, Who art our Lord.  Glorified art Thou, O God!  Grant us that which is good and seemly that we may be able to dispense with everything but Thee.  Verily, Thou art the Lord of all worlds.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>O God!  Recompense those who endure patiently in Thy days, and strengthen their hearts to walk undeviatingly in the path of Truth.  Grant then, O Lord, such goodly gifts as would enable them to gain admittance into Thy blissful Paradise.  Exalted art Thou, O Lord God.  Let Thy heavenly blessings descend upon homes whose inmates have believed in Thee.  Verily, unsurpassed art Thou in sending down divine blessings.  Send forth, O God, such hosts as would render Thy faithful servants victorious.  Thou dost fashion the created things through the power of Thy decree as Thou pleasest.  Thou art in truth the Sovereign, the Creator, the All-Wise.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Say: God is indeed the Maker of all things.  He giveth sustenance in plenty to whomsoever He willeth.  He is the Creator, the Source of all beings, the Fashioner, the Almighty, the Maker, the All-Wise.

&lt;p>Deprive not this feeble one of Thy wondrous grace and vouchsafe by Thy might unto this helpless soul Thy bounty.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Give us our daily bread and grant Thy increase in the necessities of life, that we may be dependent on none other than Thee, may walk in Thy ways and declare Thy mysteries.

&lt;p>O Thou Provider, O Thou Forgiver!  Grant us Thy grace and loving-kindness, Thy gifts and Thy bestowals, and sustain us, that we may attain our goal.

Heal Thou the sicknesses that have assailed the souls on every side, and have deterred them from directing their gaze towards the Paradise that lieth in the shelter of Thy shadowing Name, which Thou didst ordain to be the King of all names unto all who are in heaven and all who are on earth.

&lt;p>No sooner had He proclaimed Thy Cause, and risen up to carry out the things prescribed unto Him in the Tablets of Thy decree, than the Great Terror fell upon Thy creatures.

Others recognized Thee and then hesitated, others allowed the world to come in between them and Thee and to withhold them from recognizing Thee.  Others disdained Thee, and turned back from Thee, and wished to prevent Thee from achieving Thy purpose.  And yet behold how all of them are calling upon Thee, and are expecting the things they were promised in Thy Tablets.  And when the Promised One came unto them, they recognized Him not, and disbelieved in Thy signs, and repudiated Thy clear tokens, and strayed so grievously from Thy path that they slew Thy servants, through the brightness of whose faces the countenances of the Concourse on high have been illumined.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of all names, to guard Thy loved ones against Thine enemies, and to strengthen them in their love for Thee and in fulfilling Thy pleasure.  Do Thou protect them, that their footsteps may slip not, that their hearts may not be shut out as by a veil from Thee, and that their eyes may be restrained from beholding anything that is not of Thee.  Cause them to be so enraptured by the sweetness of Thy divine melodies that they will rid themselves of all attachment to any one except Thee, and will turn wholly towards Thee, and extol Thee under all conditions, saying: “Praised be Thou, O Lord our God, inasmuch as Thou hast enabled us to recognize Thy most exalted and all-glorious Self.  We will, by Thy mercy, cleave to Thee, and will detach ourselves from any one but Thee.  We have realized that Thou art the Beloved of the worlds and the Creator of earth and heaven!”&lt;/p>

As long as that self endureth, so long will Thy praise continue to be shed abroad among Thy creatures and Thy remembrance glorified by Thy people.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Every man endued with insight among Thy servants is persuaded that my self liveth eternally and can never perish, inasmuch as remembrance of Thee is eternal and will endure so long as Thine own Self endureth, and Thy praise is everlasting and will last as long as Thine own sovereignty will last.

Nay, the praise wherewith any one, in the entire creation, praiseth Thee proceedeth from this exalted self and returneth unto it, even as the sun which, while it shineth, sheddeth its splendor upon whatsoever may be exposed to its rays.  From this sun is generated, and unto it must return, the light which is shed over all things.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>And when Thou didst purpose to make Thyself known unto men, Thou didst successively reveal the Manifestations of Thy Cause, and ordained each to be a sign of Thy Revelation among Thy people, and the Day-Spring of Thine invisible Self amidst Thy creatures, until the time when, as decreed by Thee, all Thy previous Revelations culminated in Him Whom Thou hast appointed as the Lord of all who are in the heaven of revelation and the kingdom of creation, Him Whom Thou hast established as the Sovereign Lord of all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth.  He it was Whom Thou hast determined to be the Herald of Thy Most Great Revelation and the Announcer of Thy Most Ancient Splendor.  In this Thou hadst no other purpose except to try them who have manifested Thy most excellent titles unto all who are in heaven and on earth.  He it was Whom Thou hast commanded to establish His covenant with all created things.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thou didst raise Him up to occupy Thy throne before all the people of Thy creation.  Thou didst enable Him to unravel Thy mysteries, and to shine with the lights of Thine inspiration and Thy Revelation, and to manifest Thy names and Thine attributes.  Through Him Thou didst adorn the preamble of the book of Thy creation, O Thou Who art the Ruler of the universe Thou hast fashioned!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I bear witness that in His person solidity and fluidity have been joined and combined.  Through His immovable constancy in Thy Cause, and His unwavering adherence to whatsoever Thou, in the plentitude of the light of Thy glory, didst unveil to His eyes, throughout the domains of Thy Revelation and creation, the souls of Thy servants were stirred up in their longing for Thy Kingdom, and the dwellers of Thy realms rushed forth to enter into Thy heavenly dominion.  Through the restlessness He evinced in Thy path, the feet of all them that are devoted to Thee were steeled and confirmed to manifest Thy Cause amidst Thy creatures, and to demonstrate Thy sovereignty throughout Thy realm.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>How great, O my God, is this Thy most excellent handiwork, and how consummate Thy creation, which hath caused every understanding heart and mind to marvel!  And when the set time was fulfilled, and what had been preordained came to pass, Thou didst unloose His tongue to praise Thee, and to lay bare Thy mysteries before all Thy creation, O Thou Who art the Possessor of all names, and the Fashioner of earth and heaven!  Through Him all created things were made to glorify Thee, and to celebrate Thy praise, and every soul was directed towards the kingdom of Thy revelation and Thy sovereignty.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At one time, Thou didst raise Him up, O my God, and didst attire Him with the ornament of the name of Him Who conversed with Thee (Moses), and didst through Him uncover all that Thy will had decreed and Thine irrevocable purpose ordained.  At another time, Thou didst adorn Him with the name of Him Who was Thy Spirit (Jesus), and didst send Him down out of the heaven of Thy will, for the edification of Thy people, infusing thereby the spirit of life into the hearts of the sincere among Thy servants and the faithful among Thy creatures.  Again, Thou didst reveal Him, decked forth by the name of Him Who was Thy Friend (Muhammad), and caused Him to shine brightly above the horizon of Hijáz, as a token of Thy power and an evidence of Thy might.  Through Him Thou didst send unto Thy servants what enabled them to scale the heights of Thy unity, and to yearn over the wonders of Thy manifold knowledge and wisdom.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I testify, O Thou Who art the Lord of the whole creation, and the Desire of whosoever hath sought Thee, that, amidst Thy creatures, They resemble the sun which no matter how often it riseth and setteth is still the one and the same sun.  Whoso maketh any distinction between any of Them hath truly failed to attain the ultimate purpose, and to reach the highest goal, and hath been deprived of the mysteries of unity and of the lights of sanctity and oneness.  I testify, moreover, that Thou hast decreed that none on the face of the earth should equal Them, and none of Thy creatures be able to be compared with any of Them, in order that Thine own singleness and peerlessness might be recognized and established.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified, immeasurably glorified be Thy name, O my God!  How can I ever befittingly mention Thee or sufficiently praise Thee, that Thou hast manifested Him by the power of Thy might, and caused Him to shine above the horizon of Thy will, and made Him the Day-Spring of Thy signs, and the Dawning-Place of the revelation of Thy names and Thine attributes?  How bewilderingly mysterious, moreover, O my God, is His nature and all that Thou hast infused into Him, through Thy strength and by the power of Thy might!  At one time He appeareth as the water which is Life indeed, sent down out of the heaven of Thy grace, and poured forth from the clouds of Thy mercy, that Thy creatures may be endued with new life, and live as long as Thine own Kingdom endureth.  Every drop of that water would suffice to quicken the dead, and to set their faces in the direction of Thy favors and Thy gifts, and to rid them of all attachment to aught else except Thee.  At another time He revealeth Himself as the Fire which Thou didst kindle in the tree of Thy unity, whose heat melted the hearts of Thine ardent lovers when He Who is the Day-Star of the world shone forth above the horizon of ‘Iráq.  I testify, O my God, that through Him the veils of human fancy were burnt up, and the hearts of men were set towards the scene of Thy most resplendent glory.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I implore Thee, O Thou Who art the Supreme Ordainer, not to suffer me to be deprived of the breezes which are wafted in Thy days, the days whereon the sweet smell of the raiment of Thy mercy hath been shed abroad.  Neither do Thou keep me back from Thy most great Ocean, every drop of which crieth out and saith: “Great is the blessedness that awaiteth him who hath been awakened from his sleep by the breath of God which, from the source of His mercy, hath blown over all such of His creatures as have set themselves towards Him!”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thou seest, O my Lord, how Thy servants are held captive by their own selves and desires.  Redeem them from their bondage, O my God, by the power of Thy sovereignty and might, that they may turn towards Thee when He Who is the Revealer of Thy names and attributes is manifested unto men.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Cast upon this poor and desolate creature, O my Lord, the glance of Thy wealth, and flood his heart with the beams of Thy knowledge, that he may apprehend the verities of the unseen world, and discover the mysteries of Thy heavenly realm, and perceive the signs and tokens of Thy kingdom, and behold the manifold revelations of this earthly life all set forth before the face of Him Who is the Revealer of Thine own Self.

&lt;p>Hold Thou the hand of this seeker who hath set his face towards Thee, O my Lord, and draw him out of the depths of his vain imaginations, that the light of certainty may shine brightly above the horizon of his heart in the days whereon the sun of the knowledge of Thy creatures hath been darkened through the shining of the Day-Star of Thy glory; the days whereon the moon of the world's wisdom hath been eclipsed through the appearance of Thy hidden knowledge, and the manifestation of Thy well-guarded secret, and the revelation of Thine enshrined mystery; the days whereon the stars of men's doings have fallen through the rising of the orb of Thy unity and the shedding of the radiance of Thy transcendent oneness.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I beg of Thee, O my God, by Thy most exalted Word which Thou hast ordained as the Divine Elixir unto all who are in Thy realm, the Elixir through whose potency the crude metal of human life hath been transmuted into purest gold, O Thou in Whose hands are both the visible and invisible kingdoms, to ordain that my choice be conformed to Thy choice and my wish to Thy wish, that I may be entirely content with that which Thou didst desire, and be wholly satisfied with what Thou didst destine for me by Thy bounteousness and favor.  Potent art Thou to do as Thou willest.  Thou, in very truth, art the All-Glorious, the All-Wise.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Happy is the man who hath recognized Thee, and discovered the sweetness of Thy fragrance, and set himself towards Thy kingdom, and tasted of the things that have been perfected therein by Thy grace and favor.  Great is the blessedness of him who hath acknowledged Thy most excellent majesty, and whom the veils that have shut out the nations from Thee have not hindered from directing his eyes towards Thee, O Thou Who art the King of eternity and the Quickener of every moldering bone!  Blessed, also, is he that hath inhaled Thy sweet savors, and been carried away by Thine utterances in Thy days.  Blessed, moreover, be the man that hath turned unto Thee, and woe betide him that hath turned his back upon Thee.&lt;/p>

And at whatever time my pen ascribeth glory to any one of Thy names, methinks I can hear the voice of its lamentation in its remoteness from Thee, and can recognize its cry because of its separation from Thy Self.

From time immemorial Thy tender mercy hath been sent down and the process of Thy creation hath been and ever is ceaseless.  Thy handiwork is unlike the work of anyone besides Thee, and Thy goodly gifts are unparalleled by the gifts of anyone other than Thyself.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Praise be unto Thee, O my Beloved, and magnified be Thy Name.  Ever since the hour I set foot upon this fortress till the moment I shall have departed therefrom, I behold Thee established upon Thy seat of glory and majesty, sending down upon Me the manifold tokens of Thy bountiful favour and grace.  Thou beholdest that My dwelling place is but the heart of the mountains, and Thou discernest naught in My Person except the evidences of abasement and loneliness.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Lauded be Thy Name; I render Thee thanks for every instance of Thine inscrutable Decree and offer My praise for every token of Thy tribulations.  Having suffered Me to be cast into the prison, Thou didst turn it into a garden of Paradise for Me and caused it to become a chamber of the court of everlasting fellowship.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>How numerous the verses Thou didst send down unto Me, and the prayers Thou didst hear Me offer unto Thee.  How diverse the revelations which Thou didst call into being through Me and the experiences Thou didst witness in Me.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Magnified be Thy Name.  Manifold trials have been powerless to deter Me from yielding thanks unto Thee and My shortcomings have failed to keep Me back from extolling Thy virtues.  The infidels had purposed to turn My abode into one of disgrace and humiliation.  But Thou hast glorified Me through My remembrance of Thee, hast exalted Me through My praise of Thee, hast graciously aided Me through the revelations of Thy oneness, and hast conferred upon Me a great honour through the effulgent splendours of Thine ancient eternity.  To the fire Thou dost command, ‘Be thou a soothing balm unto my Servant’, and to the prison, ‘Be thou a seat of tender compassion to My servant, as a token from My presence’.  Yea, I swear by Thy glory; to Me the prison hath proved to be naught but the most delightful garden of Paradise and hath served as the noblest spot in the realm above.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Praised and glorified art Thou.  How often did adversities descend upon Me and Thou didst temper them and avert them through Thy gracious favour; and how many times were commotions stirred up against Me at the hand of the people, while Thou didst cause them to subside through Thy tender mercy.  How numerous the occasions when the Nimrods kindled fires wherewith to burn Me, but Thou didst make them balm for Me; and how manifold the instances when the infidels decreed My humiliation and Thou didst turn them into marks of honour for Me...&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Verily Thou art the highest aspiration of every earnest seeker and the Goal of the desire of them that yearn after Thee.  Thou art He Who is ready to answer the call of such as recognize Thy divine unity, and He before Whom the faint-hearted stand in awe.  Thou art the Helper of the needy, the Deliverer of the captives, the Abaser of the oppressors, the Destroyer of the wrong-doers, the God of all men, the Lord of all created things.  Thine are the kingdoms of Creation and Revelation, O Thou Who art the Lord of all the worlds.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>O All-Sufficient One!  Thou dost suffice Me in every hardship that may descend upon Me and in every affliction that may wax great before Me.  Thou art my sole Companion in My loneliness, the Delight of My heart in My solitude and My Best Beloved in My prison and in My Abode.  No God is there but Thee!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Whomsoever Thou dost suffice shall not be put to grief; whomsoever Thou dost protect shall never perish; whomsoever Thou dost help shall never be abased; and he unto whom Thou turnest Thy gaze shall never be far removed from Thee.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Write down for us then whatsoever is of Thee, and forgive us for what we are.  Verily Thou art the Lord of power and glory, the Lord of all the worlds.  ‘Far be the glory of Thy Lord, the Lord of all greatness, from what they impute to Him, and peace be upon His Apostles, and praise be unto God, the Lord of all the worlds.’¹&lt;/p></prayer><prayer title="Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God!" citation="" author="Bahá’u’lláh" category="Protection" wordCount="292">&lt;p class="opening">&lt;span class="versal">P&lt;/span>raise be to Thee, O Lord my God!

No one on earth, O my Lord, can withstand Thy power, and none in all the kingdom of Thy names is able to frustrate Thy purpose.

From everlasting Thou hast been clothed with transcendent greatness and power, with unspeakable majesty and glory.

Thou beholdest all that hath befallen them at the hands of such of Thy creatures as have transgressed and rebelled against Thee.  Thy might beareth me witness, O Thou Who art the King of the realms of justice and the Ruler of the cities of mercy!  The tribulations they have been made to suffer are such as no pen, in the entire creation, can reckon.  Should any one attempt to make mention of them, he would find himself powerless to describe them.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As these tribulations, however, were sustained in Thy path and for love of Thee, they who were afflicted by them render thanks, under all conditions, unto Thee and say: “O Thou Who art the Delight of our hearts and the Object of our adoration!  Were the clouds of Thy decree to rain down upon us the darts of affliction, we would, in our love for Thee, refuse to be impatient.  We would yield Thee praise and thanksgiving, for we have recognized and are persuaded that Thou hast ordained only that which will be best for us.  If our bodies be, at times, weighed down by our troubles, yet our souls rejoice with exceeding gladness.  We swear by Thy might, O Thou Who art the Desire of our hearts and the Exultation of our souls!  Every trouble that toucheth us in our love for Thee is an evidence of Thy tender mercy, every fiery ordeal a sign of the brightness of Thy light, every woeful tribulation a cooling draught, every toil a blissful repose, every anguish a fountain of gladness.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Whosoever, O my Lord, is impatient in the tribulations befalling him in Thy path, hath not drunk of the cup of Thy love nor tasted of the sweetness of Thy remembrance.  I implore Thee, by Him Who is the King of all names and their Sovereign, Who is the Revealer of all attributes and their Creator, and by them who have soared aloft and drawn nigh unto Thee and winged their flight into the atmosphere of Thy presence, and have endured the galling of chains for Thy sake, to grant that all Thy people may be graciously aided to recognize Him Who is the Manifestation of Thine own Self, Who, because He summoned mankind unto Thee, hath been exiled and cast into prison.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The tenderness of Thy mercy, O my Lord, surpasseth the fury of Thy wrath, and Thy loving-kindness exceedeth Thy hot displeasure, and Thy grace excelleth Thy justice.  Hold Thou, through Thy wondrous favors and mercies, the hands of Thy creatures, and suffer them not to be separated from the grace which Thou hast ordained as the means whereby they can recognize Thee.  The glory of Thy might beareth me witness!  Were such a thing to happen, every soul would be sore shaken, every man endued with understanding would be bewildered, and every possessor of knowledge would be dumbfounded, except those who have been succored through the hands of Thy Cause, and have been made the recipients of the revelations of Thy grace and of the tokens of Thy favors.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I swear by Thy might, O my God!  Wert Thou to regard Thy servants according to their deserts in Thy days, they would assuredly merit naught except Thy chastisement and torment.  Thou art, however, the One Who is of great bounteousness, Whose grace is immense.  Look not down upon them, O my God, with the glance of Thy justice, but rather with the eyes of Thy tender compassions and mercies.  Do, then, with them according to what beseemeth Thy generosity and bountiful favor.  Potent art Thou to do whatsoever may please Thee.  Incomparable art Thou.  No God is there beside Thee, the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below, the Ruler of this world and of the world to come.  Thou art the God of Bounty, the Ever-Forgiving, the Great Giver, the Most Generous.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Do Thou bless, O Lord my God, the One through Whom the mysteries of Thine omnipotence have been disclosed, through Whom the revelations of Thy divinity have been glorified, through Whom the goodly pearls of Thy knowledge and wisdom have been uncovered, through Whom Thy signs and tokens have been noised abroad, through Whom Thy word hath been set forth with clearness, through Whom the light of Thy countenance hath shone forth and the power of Thy sovereignty been established.  Bless Thou all those also who, wholly for Thy sake, have turned towards Thee.  Send down, moreover, upon Him and them such of Thy wondrous mercies as may well beseem Thy highness.

Suffer them not, O my Lord, to be numbered with them who, though enjoying near access to Thee, have been kept back from recognizing Thy face, and who, though meeting with Thee, are deprived of Thy presence.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These are Thy servants, O my Lord, who have entered with Thee in this, the Most Great Prison, who have kept the Fast within its walls according to what Thou hast commanded them in the Tablets of Thy decree and the Books of Thy behest.  Send down, therefore, upon them what will thoroughly purge them of all that Thou abhorrest, that they may be wholly devoted to Thee, and may detach themselves entirely from all except Thyself.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Rain down, then, upon us, O my God, that which beseemeth Thy grace and befitteth Thy bounty.  Enable us, then, O my God, to live in remembrance of Thee and to die in love of Thee, and supply us with the gift of Thy presence in Thy worlds hereafter—worlds which are inscrutable to all except Thee.  Thou art our Lord and the Lord of all worlds, and the God of all that are in heaven and all that are on earth.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thou beholdest, O my God, what hath befallen Thy dear ones in Thy days.  Thy glory beareth me witness!  The voice of the lamentations of Thy chosen ones hath been lifted up throughout Thy realm.  Some were ensnared by the infidels in Thy land, and were hindered by them from having near access to Thee and from attaining the court of Thy glory.  Others were able to approach Thee, but were kept back from beholding Thy face.  Still others were permitted, in their eagerness to look upon Thee, to enter the precincts of Thy court, but they allowed the veils of the imaginations of Thy creatures and the wrongs inflicted by the oppressors among Thy people to come in between them and Thee.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is the hour, O my Lord, which Thou hast caused to excel every other hour, and hast related to the choicest among Thy creatures.  I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Self and by them, to ordain in the course of this year what shall exalt Thy loved ones.  Do Thou, moreover, decree within this year what will enable the Daystar of Thy power to shine brightly above the horizon of Thy glory, and to illuminate by Thy sovereign might, the whole world.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Render Thy Cause victorious, O my Lord, and abase Thou Thine enemies.  Write down, then, for us the good of this life and of the life to come.  Thou art the Truth, Who knoweth the secret things.  No God is there but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.&lt;/p></prayer><prayer title="Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God!" citation="" author="Bahá’u’lláh" category="The Fast" wordCount="1984">&lt;p class="opening">&lt;span class="versal">G&lt;/span>lory be to Thee, O Lord my God!  These are the days whereon Thou hast bidden all men to observe the Fast, that through it they may purify their souls and rid themselves of all attachment to anyone but Thee, and that out of their hearts may ascend that which will be worthy of the court of Thy majesty and may well beseem the seat of the revelation of Thy oneness.  Grant, O my Lord, that this fast may become a river of life-giving waters and may yield the virtue wherewith Thou hast endowed it.  Cleanse Thou by its means the hearts of Thy servants whom the evils of the world have failed to hinder from turning towards Thine all-glorious Name, and who have remained unmoved by the noise and tumult of such as have repudiated Thy most resplendent signs which have accompanied the advent of Thy Manifestation Whom Thou hast invested with Thy sovereignty, Thy power, Thy majesty and glory.  These are the servants who, as soon as Thy call reached them, hastened in the direction of Thy mercy and were not kept back from Thee by the changes and chances of this world or by any human limitations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I am he, O my God, who testifieth to Thy unity, who acknowledgeth Thy oneness, who boweth humbly before the revelations of Thy majesty, and who recognizeth with downcast countenance the splendors of the light of Thy transcendent glory.  I have believed in Thee after Thou didst enable me to know Thy Self, Whom Thou hast revealed to men's eyes through the power of Thy sovereignty and might.  Unto Him I have turned, wholly detached from all things, and cleaving steadfastly unto the cord of Thy gifts and favors.  I have embraced His truth, and the truth of all the wondrous laws and precepts that have been sent down unto Him.  I have fasted for love of Thee and in pursuance of Thine injunction, and have broken my fast with Thy praise on my tongue and in conformity with Thy pleasure.  Suffer me not, O my Lord, to be reckoned among them who have fasted in the daytime, who in the night-season have prostrated themselves before Thy face, and who have repudiated Thy truth, disbelieved in Thy signs, gainsaid Thy testimony, and perverted Thine utterances.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Open Thou, O my Lord, mine eyes and the eyes of all them that have sought Thee, that we may recognize Thee with Thine own eyes.  This is Thy bidding given us in the Book sent down by Thee unto Him Whom Thou hast chosen by Thy behest, Whom Thou hast singled out for Thy favor above all Thy creatures, Whom Thou hast been pleased to invest with Thy sovereignty, and Whom Thou hast specially favored and entrusted with Thy Message unto Thy people.  Praised be Thou, therefore, O my God, inasmuch as Thou hast graciously enabled us to recognize Him and to acknowledge whatsoever hath been sent down unto Him, and conferred upon us the honor of attaining the presence of the One Whom Thou didst promise in Thy Book and in Thy Tablets.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thou seest me then, O my God, with my face turned towards Thee, cleaving steadfastly to the cord of Thy gracious providence and generosity, and clinging to the hem of Thy tender mercies and bountiful favors.  Destroy not, I implore Thee, my hopes of attaining unto that which Thou didst ordain for Thy servants who have turned towards the precincts of Thy court and the sanctuary of Thy presence, and have observed the Fast for love of Thee.  I confess, O my God, that whatever proceedeth from me is wholly unworthy of Thy sovereignty and falleth short of Thy majesty.  And yet I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast revealed Thy Self, in the glory of Thy most excellent titles, unto all created things, in this Revelation whereby Thou hast, through Thy most resplendent Name, manifested Thy beauty, to give me to drink of the wine of Thy mercy and of the pure beverage of Thy favor, which have streamed forth from the right hand of Thy will, that I may so fix my gaze upon Thee and be so detached from all else but Thee, that the world and all that hath been created therein may appear before me as a fleeting day which Thou hast not deigned to create.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I moreover entreat Thee, O my God, to rain down, from the heaven of Thy will and the clouds of Thy mercy, that which will cleanse us from the noisome savors of our transgressions, O Thou Who hast called Thyself the God of Mercy!  Thou art, verily, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the Beneficent.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Cast not away, O my Lord, him that hath turned towards Thee, nor suffer him who hath drawn nigh unto Thee to be removed far from Thy court.  Dash not the hopes of the suppliant who hath longingly stretched out his hands to seek Thy grace and favors, and deprive not Thy sincere servants of the wonders of Thy tender mercies and loving-kindness.  Forgiving and Most Bountiful art Thou, O my Lord!  Power has Thou to do what Thou pleasest.  All else but Thee are impotent before the revelations of Thy might, are as lost in the face of the evidences of Thy wealth, are as nothing when compared with the manifestations of Thy transcendent sovereignty, and are destitute of all strength when face to face with the signs and tokens of Thy power.  What refuge is there beside Thee, O my Lord, to which I can flee, and where is there a haven to which I can hasten?  Nay, the power of Thy might beareth me witness!  No protector is there but Thee, no place to flee to except Thee, no refuge to seek save Thee.  Cause me to taste, O my Lord, the divine sweetness of Thy remembrance and praise.  I swear by Thy might!  Whosoever tasteth of its sweetness will rid himself of all attachment to the world and all that is therein, and will set his face towards Thee, cleaned from the remembrance of anyone except Thee.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Inspire then my soul, O my God, with Thy wondrous remembrance, that I may glorify Thy name.  Number me not with them who read Thy words and fail to find Thy hidden gift which, as decreed by Thee, is contained therein, and which quickeneth the souls of Thy creatures and the hearts of Thy servants.  Cause me, O my Lord, to be reckoned among them who have been so stirred up by the sweet savors that have been wafted in Thy days that they have laid down their lives for Thee and hastened to the scene of their death in their longing to gaze on Thy beauty and in their yearning to attain Thy presence.  And were anyone to say unto them on their way, “Whither go ye?” they would say, “Unto God, the All-Possessing, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting!”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The transgressions committed by such as have turned away from Thee and have borne themselves haughtily towards Thee have not availed to hinder them from loving Thee, and from setting their faces towards Thee, and from turning in the direction of Thy mercy.  These are they who are blessed by the Concourse on high, who are glorified by the denizens of the everlasting Cities, and beyond them by those on whose foreheads Thy most exalted pen hath written: “These!  The people of Bahá.  Through them have been shed the splendors of the light of guidance.”  Thus hath it been ordained, at Thy behest and by Thy will, in the Tablet of Thine irrevocable decree.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Proclaim, therefore, O my God, their greatness and the greatness of those who while living or after death have circled round them.  Supply them with that which Thou hast ordained for the righteous among Thy creatures.  Potent art Thou to do all things.  There is no God but Thee, the All-Powerful, the Help in Peril, the Almighty, the Most Bountiful.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Do not bring our fasts to an end with this fast, O my Lord, nor the covenants Thou hast made with this covenant.  Do Thou accept all that we have done for love of Thee, and for the sake of Thy pleasure, and all that we have left undone as a result of our subjection to our evil and corrupt desires.  Enable us, then, to cleave steadfastly to Thy love and Thy good pleasure, and preserve us from the mischief of such as have denied Thee and repudiated Thy most resplendent signs.  Thou art, in truth, the Lord of this world and of the next.  No God is there beside Thee, the Exalted, the Most High.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Magnify Thou, O Lord my God, Him Who is the Primal Point, the Divine Mystery, the Unseen Essence, the Dayspring of Divinity, and the Manifestation of Thy Lordship, through Whom all the knowledge of the past and all the knowledge of the future were made plain, through Whom the pearls of Thy hidden wisdom were uncovered, and the mystery of Thy treasured name disclosed, Whom Thou hast appointed as the Announcer of the One through Whose name the letter B and the letter E have been joined and united, through Whom Thy majesty, Thy sovereignty and Thy might were made known, through Whom Thy words have been sent down, and Thy laws set forth with clearness, and Thy signs spread abroad, and Thy Word established, through Whom the hearts of Thy chosen ones were laid bare, and all that were in the heavens and all that were on the earth were gathered together, Whom Thou has called ‘Alí-Muhammad in the kingdom of Thy names, and the Spirit of Spirits in the Tablets of Thine irrevocable decree, Whom Thou hast invested with Thine own title, unto Whose name all other names have, at Thy bidding and through the power of Thy might, been made to return, and in Whom Thou hast caused all Thine attributes and titles to attain their final consummation.  To Him also belong such names as lay hid within Thy stainless tabernacles, in Thine invisible world and Thy sanctified cities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Magnify Thou, moreover, such as have believed in Him and in His signs and have turned towards Him, from among those that have acknowledged Thy unity in His Latter Manifestation—a Manifestation whereof He hath made mention in His Tablets, and in His Books, and in His Scriptures, and in all the wondrous verses and gem-like utterances that have descended upon Him.  It is this same Manifestation Whose covenant Thou hast bidden Him establish ere He had established His own covenant.  He it is Whose praise the Bayán hath celebrated.  In it His excellence hath been extolled, and His truth established, and His sovereignty proclaimed, and His Cause perfected.  Blessed is the man that hath turned unto Him, and fulfilled the things He hath commanded, O Thou Who art the Lord of the world and the Desire of all them that have known Thee!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Praised be Thou, O my God, inasmuch as Thou hast aided us to recognize and love Him.  I, therefore, beseech Thee by Him and by Them Who are the Daysprings of Thy Divinity, and the Manifestations of Thy Lordship, and the Treasuries of Thy Revelation, and the Depositories of Thine inspiration, to enable us to serve and obey Him, and to empower us to become the helpers of His Cause and the dispersers of His adversaries.  Powerful art Thou to do all that pleaseth Thee.  No God is there beside Thee, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the One Whose help is sought by all men!&lt;/p></prayer><prayer title="Praise be unto Thee, O Lord my God!

I beg of Thee, O my God, by these two mighty pillars, which Thou hast ordained as a glory and honor for all mankind, to keep Thy religion safe from the mischief of the ungodly and the plotting of every wicked doer.  O Lord, conceal not the light which Thou hast revealed through Thy strength and Thine omnipotence.

Write down, then, for such as have been afflicted with adversities for Thy sake, the reward of those who have suffered martyrdom in the path of Thy good-pleasure.  Send down, moreover, upon them, O Lord, that which will rejoice their hearts, solace their eyes, and exhilarate their souls.

By Thy glory!  Since they are turning to the court of Thy good-pleasure, all their days are days of fasting.  Were the mouth of Thy will to address them saying: “Observe, for My beauty's sake, the fast, O people, and set no limit to its duration,” I swear by the majesty of Thy glory, that every one of them will faithfully observe it, will abstain from whatsoever will violate Thy law, and will continue to do so until they yield up their souls unto Thee, for they have tasted the sweetness of Thy call, and become inebriated with Thy remembrance and praise and with the words proceeding from the lips of Thy command.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I beseech Thee, O Lord, by Thyself, the Exalted, the Most High, and by Thy Latter Manifestation through Whom the kingdom of names and the dominion of attributes have been convulsed, and the inhabitants of earth and heaven became intoxicated, and all who dwell in the realms of Revelation and creation trembled except such as have fasted from all that is repugnant to Thy good-pleasure and restrained themselves from turning toward aught besides Thee, to include us among them and to write down our names on the Tablet whereon Thou hast inscribed their names.  O God, through the wonders of Thy might and the tokens of Thy sovereignty and grandeur, Thou didst send forth their names from out of the sea of Thy names, and didst create their inner essences out of the substance of Thy love, and their inmost beings from the spirit of Thy Cause.  Theirs is a reunion not succeeded by separation, a nearness that knoweth no remoteness, and a perpetuity that hath no end.  Verily, these are servants who ever recount Thee, who eternally circle round Thee, and who circumambulate the sanctuary of Thy presence and the Kaaba of reunion with Thee.  Thou hast ordained, O my God, no distinction between them and Thee, except that when they beheld the lights of Thy countenance, they set their faces towards Thee, and prostrated themselves before Thy beauty, submissive to Thy greatness and severed from all things besides Thee.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We have fasted this day, O my Lord, by Thy command and Thy bidding in accordance with what Thou hast revealed in Thy perspicuous Book.  We have withheld our souls from passion and from whatsoever Thou abhorest until the day drew to an end and the time arrived to break the Fast.  Wherefore, I implore Thee, O Desire of the hearts of ardent lovers and Beloved of the souls of them who are endued with understanding, O Rapture of the breasts of them that yearn after Thee and Object of the desire of them that seek Thee, to cause us to soar in the atmosphere of Thy nearness and the heaven of Thy presence, and to accept from us what we have performed in the pathway of Thy love and good-pleasure.  Write down our names, then, among those who have acknowledged Thy oneness and confessed to Thy singleness and who have humbled themselves before the evidences of Thy majesty and the tokens of Thy grandeur, those who have taken refuge in Thy nearness and sought shelter in Thee, who have expended their lives in their eagerness to meet Thee and attain the court of Thy presence, and who have cast the world behind their backs for love of Thee and severed every tie with aught save Thee in their eagerness to draw nigh unto Thee.  These are servants whose hearts melt in ardent desire for Thy beauty at the mention of Thy Name, and whose eyes overflow with tears in their longing to find Thee and enter the precincts of Thy court.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is, O my Lord, my tongue which testifieth to Thy unity and peerlessness, mine eye which beholdeth the seat of Thy generosity and manifold bounties, and mine ear which is ready to hearken unto Thy summons and Thine utterance, for I am assured, O my God, that Thou hast decreed the words proceeding out of the mouth of Thy will to be inexhaustible, and unto them the ears which Thou hast sanctified to hear Thy words and verses are at all times hearkening.  And these are my hands, O my Lord, uplifted toward the heaven of Thy favor and tender mercy.  Wilt Thou, then, turn away this poor one who hath taken to himself no beloved except Thee, no bestower beside Thee, nor king other than Thee, no shelter save beneath the shadow of Thy mercy, and no refuge but before Thy gate, which Thou hast opened unto all who dwell in Thy heaven and on Thine earth?  Nay, by Thy glory!  I am he whose confidence in Thy loving kindness will remain undaunted even though Thou wert to afflict me with torments for the duration of Thy dominion; and should anyone ask me about Thee, every limb of my body would proclaim: “He is beloved in His acts and obeyed in His decree, merciful in His nature and compassionate to His creatures!”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thy might beareth me witness, O Well-Beloved of the hearts of them that yearn after Thee, wert Thou to turn me away from Thy door and abandon me to the swords of the tyrants amongst Thy servants and to the rods of the ungodly amongst Thy creatures, and should someone ask me about Thee, every hair of my body would still declare: “He is, in truth, the Best Beloved of the worlds; He is the Most Bountiful; He is the Ever-Abiding!  He draweth me nigh whilst distancing me from Himself; He granteth me His sanctuary whilst debarring me from His presence.  None found I more merciful than He, by Whom I have become independent of all else but Him and have been raised up above aught besides Himself.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Well is it with the one, O my God, who hath been so enriched by Thee as to be made independent of the kingdoms of earth and heaven.  Rich is the one who hath held fast to the cord of Thy wealth, is submissive before Thy face, and for whom Thou art sufficient above all things.  Poor is the one who hath dispensed with Thee, waxed proud before Thee, turned away from Thy presence, and disbelieved in Thy signs.  Suffer me, then, O my God and my Beloved, to be numbered with those whom the breezes of Thy will move as they list, not with those whom the wind of self and passion stirreth and directeth as it pleaseth.  No God is there but Thee, the Almighty, the Exalted, the Most Bountiful.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>All glory be to Thee, O my God, for Thou hast graciously enabled me to fast during this month which Thou hast related to Thy Name, the Most Exalted, and called ‘Alá (Loftiness).  Thou hast commanded that Thy servants and Thy people should fast therein and seek thereby to draw nearer unto Thee.  The days and months of the year have culminated with the Fast, even as the first month began with Thy Name, Bahá, that all might testify that Thou art the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden, and be well assured that the glory of all names is conferred only through the glory of Thy Cause and the word expounded by Thy will and revealed through Thy purpose.  Thou hast ordained that this month be a remembrance and honor from Thee, and a sign of Thy presence amongst them, that they may not forget Thy grandeur and Thy majesty, Thy sovereignty and Thy glory, and may be well assured that from time immemorial Thou hast ever been and wilt ever be Ruler over the entire creation.  Nothing created in the heavens or on the earth can hinder Thee in Thy governance, nor can anyone in the realms of Revelation and creation prevent Thee from fulfilling Thy purpose.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I implore Thee, O my God, by Thy name whereby all the kindreds of the earth have wailed, except such as Thou hast safeguarded with Thine unerring protection and sheltered beneath the shadow of Thy transcendent mercy, to make us so firm in Thy Cause and steadfast in Thy love that were Thy servants to rise up against Thee and Thy people turn away from Thee, and no one would remain on earth to invoke Thy name or set his face toward the sanctuary of communion with Thee and the Kaaba of Thy sanctity, I would still arise singly and alone to render Thy Cause victorious, to exalt Thy word, to proclaim Thy sovereignty, and to celebrate the praise of Thine august Self.  And this, O Lord, even though each time I venture to extol Thee by any name, I am filled with perplexity, for I am fully aware that all of Thine exalted attributes and all of the most excellent names which I associate with Thee and by which in Thy holy presence I supplicate Thee, reflect naught but the measure of mine own understanding, inasmuch as whenever I have regarded a name to be laudable, I have associated it with Thyself.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Immeasurably exalted is Thy true state above the description or knowledge of anyone besides Thee, and sanctified art Thou from the glorification of Thy creatures and the praise of Thy servants in their attempts to ascend unto Thee.  Whatsoever appeareth from Thy servants is limited by the limitations of their own selves and is created by their own idle fancies and imaginings.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Alas, alas, O my Beloved, for mine inability to befittingly praise Thee and for my shortcomings during Thy days!  If I acclaim Thee, O my God, as Him Who knoweth all things, I readily perceive that shouldst Thou point to a mute rock with a single finger of Thy will, Thou wouldst enable it to unfold the knowledge of all past and future ages; and if I extol Thee as the All-Powerful, I find that one word issuing from the mouth of Thy purpose is sufficient to convulse the heavens and the earth.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thy glory beareth me witness, O Beloved of all that recognize Thee, should any learned one fail to confess his ignorance before the revelations of Thy knowledge, he would be accounted the most ignorant of Thy people; and should any mighty one refuse to admit his weakness before the evidences of Thy power, he would be considered the weakest and the most heedless of Thy creatures.  Given my knowledge and certainty that this is so, how can I extol Thee or describe and praise Thee?  Wherefore, knowing my weakness, I have hastened toward the shelter of Thy strength; and realizing my poverty, I have sought refuge under the shadow of Thy wealth; and recognizing my powerlessness, I have arisen to stand before the tabernacle of Thy power and might.  Wilt thou cast away this poor one after he hath taken no one but Thee as his succorer, or turn away this stranger after he hath found no one but Thee to be his true beloved?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thou knowest all that is in me, O Lord, but I know not what is in Thee.  Have mercy then upon me through Thy loving providence and inspire me with that which shall give peace to my heart during Thy days and tranquillity to my soul through the revelations of Thy sacred presence.  All created things have been illumined with the splendors of the lights of Thy countenance, O Lord, and the dwellers of earth and heaven are shining resplendently on account of the manifestations of Thine incomparable majesty, in such wise that I behold nothing without first beholding within it the revelation of Thyself, a revelation which is hidden from the sight of those among Thy servants who lie fast asleep.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Deprive me not, O my Lord, of Thy grace which hath encompassed all the realms of existence, whether visible or invisible.  Wilt Thou stay far removed, O my God, after Thou hast invited all mankind to return and draw nigh unto Thee, and urged them to hold fast to Thy cord?  Wilt Thou cast me out, O my Beloved, even when Thou hast promised in Thine incorruptible Book and in Thy wondrous verses to gather all those who yearn after Thee within the pavilion of Thy gracious providence, and those who desire Thee under the shadow of Thy bountiful favor, and those who search for Thee under the canopy of Thy mercy and loving-kindness?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I swear by Thy might, O my God, that my lamentations have halted my heart within me, and its groans have seized the reins from my hands!   At whatever time I reassure myself and gladden my soul with the wonders of Thy mercy, the tokens of Thy gracious providence, and the evidences of Thy generosity, I tremble before the manifestations of Thy justice and the signs of Thy wrath.  I recognize that Thou art known by these two names and described by these two attributes, yet Thou carest not whether Thou art invoked by Thy name the Ever-Forgiving, or Thy name the Wrathful.  By Thy glory, were it not for my knowledge that Thy mercy surpasseth all things, the limbs of my body would have ceased to exist, my reality been extinguished and my inner being reduced to utter nothingness.  But when I behold that Thy grace encompasseth all things and Thy mercy embraceth the entire creation, my soul and my inmost being become well assured.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Alas, alas, O my God, for the things that have escaped me during Thy days, and again alas, alas, O Desire of my heart, for what I have left undone in service and obedience to Thee during these days the likes of which the eyes of Thy chosen ones and trusted ones have never witnessed!  I entreat Thee, O my Lord, by Thy Self and by the Manifestation of Thy Cause Who is seated upon the throne of Thy mercy, to confirm me in Thy service and good-pleasure.  Guard me, then, from those who have turned away from Thee and disbelieved in Thy verses, who have denied Thy truth, resisted Thine evidences, and violated Thy Covenant and testament.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>All praise, O Lord my God, be unto Him Who is the Manifestation of Thine Essence, the Dayspring of Thy oneness, the Mine of Thy knowledge, the Source of Thy Revelation, the Repository of Thine inspiration, the Seat of Thy sovereignty, and the Dawning-Place of Thy Divinity—He Who is the Primal Point, the Most Exalted Countenance, the Ancient Root, and the Quickener of nations; and glory be upon him who was the first to believe in Him and in His verses, whom Thou didst make a throne for the ascendancy of Thy most sublime Word, a focal-point for the manifestation of Thy most excellent names, a dayspring of the radiance of the Sun of Thy providence, a dawning-place for the appearance of Thy names and attributes, and a treasury of the pearls of Thy wisdom and Thy commandments.  And all honor be upon him who was the last to come unto Him, whose arrival was like His arrival, and Thy manifestation in him like Thy manifestation in Him, except that he was illumined with the lights of His face and prostrated himself before Him and testified to his servitude unto Him; and glory be upon those who were martyred in His path and who offered up their lives for love of His beauty.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We testify, O my God, that these are servants who have believed in Thee and in Thy signs, who have sought the sanctuary of Thy presence and turned toward Thy countenance, who have directed their faces toward the court of Thy nearness and walked in the path of Thy good-pleasure, who have worshipped Thee according to Thy desire and detached themselves from all but Thee.  O Lord, confer upon their spirits and their bodies at all times a share of the wonders of Thine all-encompassing mercy.  Thou art, verily, powerful to do as Thou pleaseth.  No God is there save Thee, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, Whose help is implored by all men.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I beseech Thee, O Lord, by Him and by them, and by Him Whom Thou hast established on the throne of Thy Faith and caused to overshadow all the dwellers of earth and heaven, to purify us from our transgressions, to ordain for us a seat of truth in Thy presence and to cause us to associate with those whom the adversities of the world and its misfortunes have not hindered from turning toward Thee.

The peoples of the world are sunk in the black depths of vain illusions, while their tyrants wallow in cruelty and hate.  I see nothing but the glare of searing fires that blaze upward from the nethermost abyss, I hear nothing save the thunderous roar that belloweth out from thousands upon thousands of fiery weapons of assault, while every land is crying aloud in its secret tongue: “My riches avail me nothing, and my sovereignty hath perished!”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>O my Lord, the lamps of guidance have gone out.  The flames of passion are mounting high, and malevolence is ever gaining on the world.  Malice and hate have overspread the face of the whole earth, and I find no souls except Thine own oppressed small band who are raising up this cry:&lt;/p>

I know not how to sing Thy praise, how to describe Thy glory, how to call upon Thy Name.  If I call upon Thee by Thy Name, the All-Possessing, I am compelled to recognize that He Who holdeth in His hand the immediate destinies of all created things is but a vassal dependent upon Thee, and is the creation of but a word proceeding from Thy mouth.  And if I proclaim Thee by the name of Him Who is the All-Compelling, I readily discover that He is but a suppliant fallen upon the dust, awe-stricken by Thy dreadful might, Thy sovereignty and power.  And if I attempt to describe Thee by glorifying the oneness of Thy Being, I soon realize that such a conception is but a notion which mine own fancy hath woven, and that Thou hast ever been immeasurably exalted above the vain imaginations which the hearts of men have devised.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The glory of Thy might beareth me witness!  Whoso claimeth to have known Thee hath, by virtue of such a claim, testified to his own ignorance; and whoso believeth himself to have attained unto Thee, all the atoms of the earth would attest his powerlessness and proclaim his failure.  Thou hast, however, by virtue of Thy mercy that hath surpassed the kingdoms of earth and heaven, deigned to accept from Thy servants the laud and honor they pay to Thine own exalted Self, and hast bidden them celebrate Thy glory, that the ensigns of Thy guidance may be unfurled in Thy cities and the tokens of Thy mercy be spread abroad among Thy nations, and that each and all may be enabled to attain unto that which Thou hast destined for them by Thy decree, and ordained unto them through Thine irrevocable will and purpose.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sanctified art Thou, O Lord my God.  The tongues of men fall short in extolling Thy glorious handiwork, how much more then would they falter in lauding the majesty of Thy transcendent power; and since human understanding is sore perplexed to fathom the mystery of a single object of Thy creation, how can anyone ever attain the recognition of Thine Own Being?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have known Thee by Thy making known unto me that Thou art unknowable to anyone save Thyself.  I have become apprised by the creation Thou hast fashioned out of sheer non-existence that the way to attain the comprehension of Thine Essence is barred to everyone.  Thou art God, besides Whom there is none other God.  No one except Thine Own Self can comprehend Thy nature.  Thou art without peer or partner.  From everlasting Thou hast been alone with no one else besides Thee and unto everlasting Thou wilt continue to be the same, while no created thing shall ever approach Thine exalted position.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>All men, O my God, confess their powerlessness to know Thee as Thou knowest Thine Own Being; the generative impulse Thou hast released is manifest throughout the entire creation, and all created things which Thou hast fashioned are but expressions of Thy wondrous signs.  Magnified be Thy name; Thou art immeasurably exalted above the strivings of anyone among Thy creatures to attain Thy recognition as is befitting and worthy of Thee.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Praise be unto Thee!  The way in which Thou hast called into being Thy creation out of non-existence preventeth all created things from recognizing Thee, and the manner in which Thou hast fashioned the creatures, with the limitations imposed upon them, proclaimeth their utter nothingness before the revelations of Thine attributes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Exalted art Thou, O my God!  All mankind are powerless to celebrate Thy glory and the minds of men fall short of yielding praise unto Thee.  I bear witness in Thy presence, O my God, that Thou art made known by Thy wondrous tokens and art recognized through the revelations of Thy signs.  The fact that Thou hast brought us forth into existence prompteth me to acknowledge before Thee that Thou art immeasurably exalted above our praise, and by virtue of the qualities wherewith Thou hast endowed our beings I testify unto Thee that Thou art transcendent beyond our comprehension.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Grant that I may soar to the noblest heights in approaching Thee, and enable me to draw nigh unto Thee through the fragrance of Thy holiness.  Thus may all impediments be dissolved by the light of ecstasy, and all remoteness from Thee be dissipated by my attainment unto the seats of reunion, and the subtle veils which have hindered me from entering Thy mansion of glory become so rarified that I may gain admittance into Thy presence, take up my abode near Thee, and voice the expressions of praise wherewith Thou hast described Thine Own Self unto me, bearing witness that Thou art God, that there is no God but Thee, the One, the Incomparable, the Ever-Abiding, that Thou dost not beget, neither art Thou begotten, that Thou hast no offspring, no partner, nor is there any protector against humiliation but Thee, and Thou art the Lord of all worlds.  I bear witness also that all besides Thee are but Thy creatures, and are held within Thy grasp.  No one is favoured with means or liveth in want except by Thy Will.

&lt;p>With utmost lowliness I raise my suppliant hands to Thy kingdom of beauty and fervently call upon Thee with my inner tongue, saying:  O God, my God!  Aid me to adore Thee, strengthen my loins to serve Thee; assist me by Thy grace in my servitude to Thee; suffer me to remain steadfast in my obedience to Thee; pour forth upon me the liberal effusions of Thy bounty, let the glances of the eye of Thy loving-kindness be directed towards me, and immerse me in the ocean of Thy forgiveness.  Grant that I may be confirmed in my allegiance to Thy Faith, and bestow upon me a fuller measure of certitude and assurance, that I may wholly dispense with the world, may turn my face with entire devotion towards Thy face, be reinforced by the compelling power of proofs and testimonies, and, invested with majesty and power, may pass beyond every region of heaven and earth.  Verily Thou art the Merciful, the All-Glorious, the Kind, the Compassionate.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>O Lord!  These are the survivors of the martyrs, that company of blessed souls.  They have sustained every tribulation and displayed patience in the face of grievous injustice.  They have forsaken all comfort and prosperity, have willingly submitted to dire suffering and adversity in the path of Thy love, and are still held captive in the clutches of their enemies who continually torment them with sore torment, and oppress them because they walk steadfastly in Thy straight path.  There is no one to help them, no one to befriend them.  Apart from the ignoble and the wicked, there is no one to associate and consort with them.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>O Lord!  These souls have tasted bitter agony in this earthly life and have, as a sign of their love for the shining beauty of Thy countenance and in their eagerness to attain Thy celestial kingdom, tolerated every gross indignity that the people of tyranny have inflicted upon them.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>O Lord!  Fill their ears with the verses of divine assistance and of a speedy victory, and deliver them from the oppression of such as wield terrible might.  Withhold the hands of the wicked and leave not these souls to be torn by the claws and teeth of fierce beasts, for they are captivated by their love for Thee, entrusted with the mysteries of Thy holiness, stand humbly at Thy door and have attained to Thine exalted precinct.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>O Lord!  Graciously reinforce them with a new spirit; illumine their eyes by enabling them to behold Thy wondrous evidences in the gloom of night; destine for them all good that aboundeth in Thy Kingdom of eternal mysteries; make them as brilliant stars shining over all regions, luxuriant trees laden with fruit and branches moving in the breezes of dawn.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Since thou hast adorned them, O my Lord, with the ornament of the Fast prescribed by Thee, do Thou adorn them also with the ornament of Thine acceptance, through Thy grace and bountiful favor.  For the doings of men are all dependent upon Thy good-pleasure, and are conditioned by Thy behest.  Shouldst Thou regard him who hath broken the Fast as one who hath observed it, such a man would be reckoned among them who from eternity had been keeping the Fast.  And shouldst Thou decree that he who hath observed the Fast hath broken it, that person would be numbered with such as have caused the Robe of Thy Revelation to be stained with dust, and been far removed from the crystal waters of this living Fountain.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thou art He through Whom the ensign “Praiseworthy art Thou in Thy works” hath been lifted up, and the standard “Obeyed art Thou in Thy behest” hath been unfurled.  Make known this Thy station, O my God, unto Thy servants, that they may be made aware that the excellence of all things is dependent upon Thy bidding and Thy word, and the virtue of every act is conditioned by Thy leave and the good pleasure of Thy will, and may recognize that the reins of men's doings are within the grasp of Thine acceptance and Thy commandment.  Make this known unto them, that nothing whatsoever may shut them out from Thy Beauty, in these days whereon the Christ exclaimeth: “All dominion is Thine, O Thou the Begetter of the Spirit (Jesus)”; and Thy Friend (Muhammad) crieth out: “Glory be to Thee, O Thou the Best-Beloved, for that Thou hast uncovered Thy Beauty, and written down for Thy chosen ones what will cause them to attain unto the seat of the revelation of Thy Most Great Name, through which all the peoples have lamented except such as have detached themselves from all else except Thee, and set themselves towards Him Who is the Revealer of Thyself and the Manifestation of Thine attributes.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thus have their superstitions become veils between them and their own hearts and kept them from the path of God, the Exalted, the Great.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Be thou assured in thyself that verily, he who turns away from this Beauty hath also turned away from the Messengers of the past and showeth pride towards God from all eternity to all eternity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">And thus proclaimed:  “By the Lord!  He whose heart hath not the fragrance of the love of the exalted and glorious Arabian Youth,&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">“Can in no wise ascend unto the glory of the highest heaven.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">Thereupon she summoned unto herself one maiden from her handmaidens,&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">And commanded her:  “Descend into space from the mansions of eternity,&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">“Perchance they may find from their robes the fragrance of the Beloved One.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">Thereupon the countenance of the favored damsel beamed above the celestial chambers even as the light that shineth from the face of the Youth above His mortal temple;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">She then descended with such an adorning as to illumine the heavens and all that is therein.&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">She bestirred herself and perfumed all things in the lands of holiness and grandeur.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">When she reached that place she rose to her full height in the midmost heart of creation,&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">And sought to inhale their fragrance at a time that knoweth neither beginning nor end.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">She found not in them that which she did desire, and this, verily, is but one of His wondrous tales.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">She then cried aloud, wailed and repaired to her own station within her most lofty mansion,&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">And then gave utterance to one mystic word, whispered privily by her honeyed tongue,&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">And raised the call amidst the Celestial Concourse and the immortal maids of heaven:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">“By the Lord!  I found not from these idle claimants the breeze of Faithfulness!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">“By the Lord!  The Youth hath remained lone and forlorn in the land of exile in the hands of the ungodly.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">She then uttered within herself such a cry that the Celestial Concourse did shriek and tremble,&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">And she fell upon the dust and gave up the spirit.  It seemeth she was called and hearkened unto Him that summoned her unto the Realm on High.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">Glorified be He that created her out of the essence of love in the midmost heart of His exalted paradise!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be my Lord, the All-Glorious!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">Thereupon the maids of heaven hastened forth from their chambers, upon whose countenances the eye of no dweller in the highest paradise had ever gazed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be our Lord, the Most High!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">They all gathered around her, and lo! they found her body fallen upon the dust;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Glorified be our Lord, the Most High!&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="noindent">And as they beheld her state and comprehended a word of the tale told by the Youth, they bared their heads, rent their garments asunder, beat upon their faces, forgot their joy, shed tears and smote with their hands upon their cheeks, and this is verily one of the mysterious grievous afflictions—&lt;/p>

It is also frequently used in commemorating Their anniversaries.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="opening">&lt;span class="versal">T&lt;/span>he praise which hath dawned from Thy most august Self, and the glory which hath shone forth from Thy most effulgent Beauty, rest upon Thee, O Thou Who art the Manifestation of Grandeur, and the King of Eternity, and the Lord of all who are in heaven and on earth!  I testify that through Thee the sovereignty of God and His dominion, and the majesty of God and His grandeur, were revealed, and the Daystars of ancient splendor have shed their radiance in the heaven of Thine irrevocable decree, and the Beauty of the Unseen hath shone forth above the horizon of creation.  I testify, moreover, that with but a movement of Thy Pen Thine injuction “Be Thou” hath been enforced, and God's hidden Secret hath been divulged, and all created things have been called into being, and all the Revelations have been sent down.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I bear witness, moreover, that through Thy beauty the beauty of the Adored One hath been unveiled, and through Thy face the face of the Desired One hath shone forth, and that through a word from Thee Thou hast decided between all created things, causing them who are devoted to Thee to ascend unto the summit of glory, and the infidels to fall into the lowest abyss.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I bear witness that he who hath known Thee hath known God, and he who hath attained unto Thy presence hath attained unto the presence of God.  Great, therefore, is the blessedness of him who hath believed in Thee, and in Thy signs, and hath humbled himself before Thy sovereignty, and hath been honored with meeting Thee, and hath attained the good pleasure of Thy will, and circled around Thee, and stood before Thy throne.  Woe betide him that hath transgressed against Thee, and hath denied Thee, and repudiated Thy signs, and gainsaid Thy sovereignty, and risen up against Thee, and waxed proud before Thy face, and hath disputed Thy testimonies, and fled from Thy rule and Thy dominion, and been numbered with the infidels whose names have been inscribed by the fingers of Thy behest upon Thy holy Tablets.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Waft, then, unto me, O my God and my Beloved, from the right hand of Thy mercy and Thy loving-kindness, the holy breaths of Thy favors, that they may draw me away from myself and from the world unto the courts of Thy nearness and Thy presence.  Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee.  Thou, truly, hast been supreme over all things.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The remembrance of God and His praise, and the glory of God and His splendor, rest upon Thee, O Thou Who art His Beauty!  I bear witness that the eye of creation hath never gazed upon one wronged like Thee.  Thou wast immersed all the days of Thy life beneath an ocean of tribulations.  At one time Thou wast in chains and fetters; at another Thou wast threatened by the sword of Thine enemies.  Yet, despite all this, Thou didst enjoin upon all men to observe what had been prescribed unto Thee by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>May my spirit be a sacrifice to the wrongs Thou didst suffer, and my soul be a ransom for the adversities Thou didst sustain.  I beseech God, by Thee and by them whose faces have been illumined with the splendors of the light of Thy countenance, and who, for love of Thee, have observed all whereunto they were bidden, to remove the veils that have come in between Thee and Thy creatures, and to supply me with the good of this world and the world to come.  Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Bless Thou, O Lord my God, the Divine Lote-Tree and its leaves, and its boughs, and its branches, and its stems, and its offshoots, as long as Thy most excellent titles will endure and Thy most august attributes will last.  Protect it, then, from the mischief of the aggressor and the hosts of tyranny.  Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.  Bless Thou, also, O Lord my God, Thy servants and Thy handmaidens who have attained unto Thee.  Thou, truly, art the All-Bountiful, Whose grace is infinite.  No God is there save Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.&lt;/p></prayer><prayer title="Tablet of Visitation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá" citation="" author="'Abdu’l-Bahá" category="Special Tablets" wordCount="343">&lt;p class="comment">(This prayer, revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, is read at His Shrine.

&lt;p>O Lord, my God!  Give me Thy grace to serve Thy loved ones, strengthen me in my servitude to Thee, illumine my brow with the light of adoration in Thy court of holiness, and of prayer to Thy kingdom of grandeur.  Help me to be selfless at the heavenly entrance of Thy gate, and aid me to be detached from all things within Thy holy precincts.  Lord!  Give me to drink from the chalice of selflessness; with its robe clothe me, and in its ocean immerse me.  Make me as dust in the pathway of Thy loved ones, and grant that I may offer up my soul for the earth ennobled by the footsteps of Thy chosen ones in Thy path, O Lord of Glory in the Highest.&lt;/p>

Lauded and glorified art Thou; I yield Thee praise inasmuch as Thou didst reveal Thyself unto me, and I beg Thee to forgive me, since I have fallen short in my duty to know Thee and have failed to walk in the path of Thy love.&lt;/p></prayer><prayer title="O Lord!
